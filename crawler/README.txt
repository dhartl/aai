To start crawling use following command:

scrapy crawl <NAME> -o <OUTPUT>.json -t json

OUTPUT: Filename (& Filepath)
NAME can be: "apo", "doc_ktn"

If you want to debug the scraper, just start with the "runner.py" script and set a break-point in your spider.
Just configure the correct one in the "runner.py" script
